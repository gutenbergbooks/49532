<span class="small">IMPROVEMENT IN FIRE-ARMS AND IN THE APPARATUS USED THEREWITH.</span><br />
————————</div>
<p class='center'>Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. <b>1,304</b>, dated August 29, 1839.</p>


<p class="unindent"><i>To all whom it may concern:</i></p>

<p>Be it known that I, <i>Samuel Colt</i>, of Paterson,
in the county of Passaic and State of
New Jersey, did obtain Letters Patent of the
United States for an Improvement in Fire-Arms,
which Letters Patent bear date on the
25th day of February, in the year 1836, and
that I have made certain improvements in the
construction of the said fire-arms, and also in
the apparatus for loading and priming the
same; and I do hereby declare that the following
is a full and exact description of my said
improvements.</p>

<p>My first improvements appertain to rifles,
guns, and pistols; my second to the construction
of a cap-primer for containing the percussion-caps
and placing the same upon the nipples,
and my third to a flask and other apparatus
for loading the rifle or gun.</p>

<p>For the general construction of my fire-arms,
as originally patented I refer to the Letters
Patent first above named, the same being necessary
to a perfect understanding of the improvements
thereon, which I am now about to
describe.</p>

<p>Figure 1 in the accompanying drawings represents
a section through the lock and breech
of my rifle or gun and two of the chambers of
the revolving receiver, B being a part of the
barrel of the gun. The mouths of the chambers
and the end of the barrel have their edges
chamfered or beveled, as shown at <i>a a</i> in the
drawings. In all guns of this description there
is necessarily a lateral discharge between the
receiver and the barrel, and this lateral discharge
may endanger the ignition of the powder
in the loaded chambers not in contact with
the barrel; but the ignited matter, by coming
into contact with the beveled edge as it crosses
said chamber, is effectually reflected off, and
does not enter them. The beveling of the end
of the barrel is not a thing of importance, it
being intended merely to prevent its scraping
or cutting the ball in its passage from the
chamber.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 shows a part of the arbor upon which
the receiver turns. <i>b</i> is the portion thereof
which is immediately below the chamber in contact
with the barrel, and in this part a channel or
groove is made descending from the point <i>b</i> in
both directions, so as to form two inclined planes
meeting at the point <i>b</i>. These planes or sections
of the grooves may form an angle at forty-five
degrees with each other. This groove
or channel serves as a chimney to conduct off
the smoke of the lateral discharge, so that it
shall pass directly between the receiver and
the barrel and prevent its spreading, so as to
pass in between the receiver and the arbor and
the barrel and the arbor, and consequently
from condensing there and rendering them
foul. The barrel is connected with the receiver
and with the stock of the gun by the aid of
the arbor which at the rear end, is a solid
piece with the shield or solid piece of metal
which receives the recoil and constitutes a
component part of the metallic frame-work or
foundation of the lock and its appendages.
The part C of the arbor is that upon which the
receiver revolves, and the part C′ enters a cylindrical
cavity in a mass of iron, D D, to which
the barrel is brazed or otherwise attached.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the piece of iron D D and a
part of the barrel B which is attached to it.
The dotted lines in this represent the cylindrical
cavity which receives the outer end of the arbor
C′. The two are keyed together by the
passing of a suitable key through a mortise in
the piece D D and a corresponding one in the
arbor.</p>

<p><i>c</i>, Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5, represents the key.
Fig. 4 shows its upper and Fig. 5 its under
side, <i>d d</i> are two fluted channels along its
upper side to receive the heads of two screws
which are screwed into the piece D D close to
the mortise and on the side opposite to that
shown in Fig. 3. The heads of these screws
lap a little over the mortise and are received
into the fluted channels <i>d d</i>. These heads prevent
the key from falling out and check it in
either direction, and must be withdrawn in order
to remove the key. As the key <i>c</i> is to act
laterally as a wedge to draw the receiver and
the barrel into proper contact, it is of importance
that it should be checked when forced
sufficiently far in, or the receiver might be
wedged up and prevented from turning. For
this purpose I insert a screw, <i>e</i>, Fig. 3, into the
steel button <i>f</i>, which is attached to D D, to
strengthen the end of the mortise and prevent
the bruising of it by the recoil. The head of
this screw, overlapping the end of the mortise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
receives the wedge and checks it. By turning
this screw the force of the wedge may be tempered.
In Fig. 5, <i>g</i> is a spring-latch on the under
side of the key, which catches upon D
when the key is forced in and prevents its accidental
removal.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 represents a percussion tube or nipple,
through which the fire from the percussion-cap
is to be conducted to the chamber. Fig.
7 represents the same in section. The outer end,
<i>h</i>, of the tube has the opening made as large
as convenience will allow, and it goes tapering
or conical until at the inner end, <i>i</i>, it is as small
as a proper entrance of the flame from the percussion-powder
will warrant. By giving the
conical or funnel-formed opening to the tube
the effect of the percussion-powder is greatly
increased.</p>

<p>E, Figs. 1 and 8, is a bolt for locking the
receiver when a loaded chamber is brought
to coincide with the barrel, the rounded end <i>j</i>
being forced into a hole in the receiver by the
action of a spring on its outer end <i>k</i>. This
bolt is drawn back by the hammer F in the
act of cocking.</p>

<p><i>l</i>, Figs. 1 and 9, is a spring-cam, which is
screwed to the hammer at <i>m</i>. It is made of
spring-steel, so that its cam end <i>n</i> may recede
from or approach the hammer F. The cam <i>n</i>
bears against the projection <i>o</i> on the bolt E
on the side which lies against the hammer,
and as the hammer is drawn back causes the
bolt to recede. The bolt is notched to enable
it to be withdrawn without interfering with
the joint-pin <i>q</i> of the hammer. The lateral
springing of the cam-piece <i>l</i> is necessary to admit
of its passing by the projection <i>o</i> of the
bolt when the hammer is made to strike upon
a percussion-cap. To enable the spring-cam
to pass the bolt E, the lower end of it, <i>n</i>, is
made wedge-shaped, diminishing to a point or
edge at its extremity, and as it is made to
spring laterally it is received into a recess in
the hammer as the latter passes the bolt in
making the discharge.</p>

<p>Fig. 10 shows the ratchet-wheel and hand
or pawl by which the receiver is made to revolve
to the distance from one chamber to another
in the act of cocking. The cylindrical
periphery <i>q</i> of the ratchet-wheel fits into a
corresponding cavity on the back end of the
receiver, as shown at <i>q q</i>, Fig. 1. <i>r</i> is a projection
to prevent its turning round, this being
adapted to a notch made to receive it. S is a
hand or pawl, which falls into the teeth of the
ratchet-wheel, said pawl being forced forward
by the spring S′. The arbor <i>t</i> on which the
hand turns is received into the opening <i>t</i>. In
the hammer, Fig. 1, the hand itself being on
the opposite side of said hammer from that
shown, its position is shown by the dotted
lines surrounding its arbor <i>t</i>. The cocking of
the gun causes it to act upon the ratchet-wheel,
and when turned to the proper distance the
bolt E is forced by its spring into the proper
opening in the receiver. The mainspring is
connected to the lock-plate at <i>u</i>, and to the
hammer by a stirrup at V. The trigger is
shown at <i>w</i>. These parts, not differing in their
construction and operation from analogous
parts in other gun-locks, need no particular
description, and from the description above
given of the structure and operation of those
parts of the rifle or gun which are new, the
action of the whole will, it is believed, be
clearly understood.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 is a sectional view of a pistol, the
general construction of which is the same
with that of the rifle or gun already described,
such modifications only being made as are
rendered necessary by its size and other considerations.
F is the hammer carrying the
hand or pawl S, which operates on the ratchet-wheel,
which wheel and hand are arranged in
the same way with the same parts in the rifle;
but the hand is as here represented on the reverse
side. The bolt which holds the receiver
is, however, differently constructed to enable
it to act in the space which it must occupy.</p>

<p>Fig. 12 is a view of the hammer on the side
the reverse of that shown in Fig. 11; and E,
Fig. 13, is the bolt adapted thereto. <i>j</i> is the
pin on the bolt, which holds the receiver by
falling into openings on its periphery instead
of in its end. The pin <i>j</i> is shown in place in
Fig. 11. The bolt E vibrates on a joint-pin at
<i>x</i>, which is nearly in the same line with the
joint-pin <i>y</i> on the trigger, Figs. 11 and 15,
by which it is hidden in those figures. <i>z</i> is a
cam formed in a recess in the hammer, Fig.
12, which cam is to act upon the bolt E and
to disengage it from the receiver. The ends
<i>a′ a<sup>2</sup></i> of this bolt are capable of receding from
or approaching toward each other, as they constitute
two spring-cheeks formed by splitting
or forking the bolts, as shown in the drawings.
The end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> lies above the cam <i>z</i> on the hammer
when the pistol is not cocked, and the lower
end of <i>a<sup>2</sup></i>, as well as the upper end of <i>z</i>, being
flat, the bolt E is lifted in the act of cocking
until the pin <i>j</i> is disengaged, and the ends of
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>z</i> then pass each other. The cam <i>z</i> is
made wedge shape by sloping from its upper
to its lower end, and the end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> of the bolt is
similarly formed, but in the reverse direction,
so that when the piece is discharged the end
<i>a<sup>2</sup></i> will be made to spring in, allowing the hammer
to pass readily, when the end <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> again
rests upon <i>z</i> as before.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 shows the hammer with the hand S
and ratchet <i>q</i>, which need no further description.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 shows the trigger and its appendages,
which are formed in a way not presenting any
claim to novelty. <i>u</i> is the attachment of the
mainspring to the lock-plate, and <i>v</i> its attachment
to the stirrup and hammer.</p>

<p>Fig. 16 shows the apparatus which I employ
for forcing the balls into the chambers. <i>b<sup>2</sup> b<sup>2</sup></i>
are two of the chambers, shown in section; and
C, the arbor by which the barrel is attached to
the stock and upon which the receiver turns,
as already explained. G is a lever carrying a
rammer, H, by which the balls are to be forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
into the chambers. The forward end of the
lever H passes into the mortise <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, which receives
the key by which the barrel is attached.
The operation of the rammer H upon the ball
<i>d′</i> will be apparent. In using this lever the
receiver is to be turned upon the arbor, and
the chambers brought in succession under the
rammer. This lever, at its end <i>e′</i>, constitutes
a wrench for screwing and unscrewing the percussion-tubes,
and also contains a picker attached
to a screw-cap, <i>f′</i>. A fulcrum for the
lever H may be formed on the barrel or otherwise,
instead of using the mortise <i>c<sup>2</sup></i>, if preferred.</p>

<p>Figs. 17 and 18 are a top and sectional view
of my improved cap-primer, which differs in
some important particulars from the English
and other cap-primers now in use. I make a
spiral groove, <i>a a a</i>, in a plate of brass or other
metal, which groove is of such depth and width
as to receive the percussion-caps, and to allow
them to move freely therein. <i>b b b</i> are caps
within said groove. In the center of the primer,
under the plate <i>c c</i>, is a spiral spring, <i>d d</i>, operating
like the mainspring of a watch upon
its barrels and turning the plate <i>c c</i>. This
plate has a groove across it which carries a
sliding arm, <i>e e′</i>, having under its end <i>e′</i> a projecting
piece which enters the groove, draws
the arm out, and presses upon the row of caps.
At the mouth of the spiral groove, where the
the cap <i>b′</i> is seen, a steel spring, <i>f</i>, checks the
cap and counteracts the pressure of the spiral
spring <i>d d</i>; but when the cap <i>b′</i> is placed upon
the tube or nipple the spring <i>f</i> will recede by
the withdrawal of the cap, and a new one will
be made to occupy its place, and so on until
the whole are exhausted. The cover <i>g</i>, which
in Fig. 17 is shown as raised, is held down by
a spring-catch at <i>h</i>. There is a spring-catch
at <i>i</i>, which holds the sliding arm <i>e</i> at its end
<i>e′</i>, when it is brought round to the inner end
of the spiral groove, its use being to detain the
arm while the groove is being filled with caps,
when it is to be raised, and the arm left at
liberty to operate. The spring <i>d d</i> may be
wound up by a small key, <i>k</i>, or by inserting a
screw driver in a notch made for that purpose,
or simply by forcing the arm <i>e e</i> round until it
is caught by the catch <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 19 is a representation of my ammunition-flask,
by means of which all the chambers
in my receiver may be simultaneously charged
with powder and with balls. It consists of two
separate chambers, one of which is a powder
and the other a bullet magazine, <i>a</i> being the
former and <i>b</i> the latter, the two being connected
together by a bayonet-joint at <i>c</i>. <i>d d d</i> are
charging-tubes adapted in number and position
to the mouths of the chambers of the receiver
which they are to enter.</p>

<p>Fig. 21 shows the closed top of the powder-magazine,
with a valve or turn cover, <i>e</i>, which
closes a hole through which the magazine
is to be filled. This magazine occupies the
space from <i>f</i> to <i>g</i>, Fig. 19, where the powder
is contained in bulk. The space from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>
is a receptacle which is divided by partitions
into separate chambers, the same in number
with the tubes <i>d d</i>, each of which chambers
contains the quantity of powder required for
the charge of a single chamber, <i>i i</i> is the
rim of this chambered receptacle, which is
capable of being turned round to a short distance
by the thumb and finger for the purpose
of charging the chambers with powder. This
turning round brings openings <i>u u</i>, Fig. 20, in
the lower end of the chambered box to coincide
with the openings in the tubes <i>d d</i>, so that
the powder contained in the chambers in <i>i i</i>
may pass out therefrom into the chambers of
the receiver. There are openings also in the
upper plate or top of the receptacle <i>i i</i> corresponding
with openings in the bottom of the
magazine <i>a</i>, which are closed by turning the
rim <i>i i</i>, so as to prevent powder from falling
through from the magazine while the receiver
is being filled.</p>

<p>Fig. 27 is a section through the middle of the
chambered receptacle <i>i i</i>, the circles <i>r r</i> representing
the chambers for containing the powder.
<i>s s</i> are the openings in the top plate of
these chambers, through which the powder is
admitted into them from the magazine <i>a</i>. The
dotted lines <i>t t</i> show the plan of the openings
in the bottom plate of the chamber <i>a</i>, the chambered
receiver being shown in the position in
which those openings are covered.</p>

<p>In Fig. 28 the same parts are represented;
but the chambered receiver is supposed to be
turned round or standing in its ordinary position,
so that the openings S S and <i>t t</i> coincide.
The chambered receptacle is restored to its
place by means of a spring of any suitable form.
The whole operation of this part will be more
clearly made known by the sectional representation
of the magazine for balls, which I am
now about to describe.</p>

<p>The end of the flask, Fig. 19, is, I have said,
the magazine for balls. Fig. 22 is an end view
of this magazine, and Fig. 23 a section along
its axis. The portion from <i>f</i> to <i>j</i>, Figs. 19, 23,
and 24, is divided into as many tubular chambers
as there are chambers in the receiver&mdash;say
five. These are open at top and are to be
filled with balls, as shown at <i>k k</i> in the section
Fig. 23. These tubes are also open at their
lower ends, so that the balls may pass from
them into a chambered receptacle, <i>l l</i>, similar
to that for the powder. From this chambered
receptacle they are to fall into the chambers
of the receiver when the lower end of the flask,
Fig. 22, is applied thereto for that purpose, the
openings <i>m m</i> in the lower end of the flask being
adapted thereto. The rim of the chambered
receiver <i>l l</i> is to be turned round to allow
the balls to escape through <i>m m</i>, as already
described in the charging with powder.
In Fig. 22, <i>n n</i> are the divisions between the
chambers of the chambered receiver, and which
retain one set or tier of balls until the rim is
turned around so as to cause the chambers to
coincide with the openings <i>m m</i>. The balls will
then pass through. The same motion of the
chambered receiver causes the divisions between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the tubes and the chambered receiver
to pass under and sustain the balls in the magazine.
In the case of the powder-magazine
the action is the same; but the powder being
in fine particles, the apertures at one end of the
receptacles must be perfectly closed before
those at the other begin to be opened, which is
not necessary with the balls. In Fig. 24 a portion
of the exterior of the magazine is removed
to show how a spring, <i>o o</i>, may be placed within
it so as to act upon <i>l l</i>; but spiral or other springs
may be placed in many ways to answer the
same purpose. The central part of both the
magazines is tubular, as shown at <i>p p</i>, said
tube fitting onto the arbor C′, Fig. 16, when
the barrel is removed therefrom, and the receiver
left on for the purpose of being charged,
which operation does not require to be further
explained. Upon the barrel of this tubular
part the chambered receptacles are received
and revolve.</p>

<p>Figs. 25 and 26 represent a top view and a
side view of a part of an improved bullet-mold,
which I describe without intending to make
any claim thereto, but merely for the purpose
of showing the whole of the apparatus employed
in a complete and connected series.
<i>a a</i> are the two handles of the mold, and <i>b</i> the
handle of the knife by which the sprue is cut
off. <i>c</i> is one-half of the mold, of which <i>d d</i> is
the hinge-joint. <i>e</i> is a plate of steel, through
which there is a hole, <i>f</i>, for pouring in the lead,
the lower edges of which constitute a knife by
which the sprue is cut off and the ball left perfect.
This knife turns on the joint-pin <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus fully described the manner in
which I construct and use my improved fire-arms,
and the respective articles of apparatus
appertaining thereto, it has been necessary in
so doing to mention many parts which I do not
claim as new, the same being similar to what
has been before used and patented by me, or
which are common property. I do hereby declare,
therefore, that I limit my claim to the
following particulars.</p>

<p>I claim—<br /></p>

<p>1. The making of a groove or channel on
the arbor, as represented at <i>b</i>, Fig. 2, for the
purpose of conducting off the smoke from the
lateral discharge, and thus preserving the arbor
clean within the receiver, and the tube by
which the barrel is connected.</p>

<p>2. The particular manner of forming and
governing the key by which the barrel is attached
to the stock by making the same with
grooves in which the heads of overlapping
screw-heads are received, and with a tempering-screw
to check and regulate its action as a
wedge, as set forth.</p>

<p>3. The making the aperture through the tubes
or nipples (which receive the percussion-caps)
conical or funnel-shaped, for the purpose of
freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap
and concentrating it as it enters the chamber.</p>

<p class="center">Disclaimer forming part of Letters Patent No. <b>1,304</b>, dated August 29, 1839.</p>

<p class="unindent"><i>To the Honorable Commissioner of Patents:</i></p>

<p>The petition of <span class="smcap">Samuel Colt</span>, of Hartford,
in the State of Connecticut, respectfully represents
that he is the sole patentee and owner of
Letters Patent granted to him on the 29th day
of August, 1839, for an improvement in fire-arms
and in the apparatus used therewith;
that he has reason to believe that through inadvertence
and mistake the claim made in the
specification of said Letters Patent is too broad,
including that of which the said patentee was not
the first inventor, although he avers that he
was an original inventor thereof, and had no
knowledge when he applied for Letters Patent
therefor that any other person had ever used
the said improvement before that time.</p>

<p>Your petitioner therefore hereby enters his
disclaimer to that part of the claim in the before-mentioned
specification which is in the following
words, viz:</p>

<p>“I claim making the aperture through the
tubes or nipples (which receive the percussion-caps)
conical or funnel shaped, for the purpose
of freely admitting the fire from the percussion-cap
and concentrating it as it enters the chamber,”
which disclaimer is to operate to the extent
of the interest in said Letters Patent vested
in your petitioner, the same being the whole
right, title, and interest thereby granted to
him, as aforesaid, he having paid ten dollars
into the Treasury of the United States agreeably
to the provisions of the act of Congress in
that case made and provided.</p>

<p>Dated at Hartford this 5th day of August,
A. D. 1853.</p>
